# Image Analyser

A Java application used to search local images using Microsoft Azure Cogitive Services

## Context
This project is the final academic project for the course called "OOP1" (Object-Oriented Programming), using `Java` and taken back in Spring 2023.

## Description and goals
The main goal of the project was to demonstrate our understanding of the 4 pillars of OOP (encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance and polymorphism) in a project that searches through images of a local directory, and, as a bonus, on Twitter (now X) using some search string.

## Tech stack
- Java 17

## Concepts used and developped
- OOP
- API Calls
- JSON Manipulation

## Tests
This project does not yet include automated tests, but I have ensured code quality and clarity, and I am aware that some classes/methods can use some refactoring.  
I am familiar with unit testing best practices and plan to add tests in future projects.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:  
   `git clone https://github.com/JadMlb/Image-Analyser.git`
   
1. Add a `.env` file with your API Key

1. Compile the sources:  
   `javac -d bin src/*.java`

1. Run the application:  
   `java -cp bin Main`
